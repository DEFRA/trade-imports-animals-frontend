# Testing — what proves what

The spike ships 385 vitest tests across 15 files. Their job is to
catch drift when the obligations / domain / flow model changes. This
document is the receipt: sixteen realistic mutations of the model
applied over three rounds, each showing exactly which tests fire.

Round 1 (mutations 1-5) exposed two coverage gaps; both closed.
Round 2 (mutations 6-11) exposed one more gap; also closed.
Round 3 (mutations 12-16) exposed one more gap (closed) and one
deferred to UX-review. See the round summaries at the end for the
full closure story.

Baseline before every mutation: **15 test files, 385 tests, all pass.**
Run:

```bash
npx vitest run prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/
```

Each mutation section below records the change, the count and identity
of failing tests, a sample error message, and what invariant the tests
catch. All five mutations were applied to `spike/EUDPA-249-flow-layer`
at HEAD `71bb020`, run through vitest, and then reverted.

---

## Mutation 1 — rename an obligation

**Change:** rename `reasonForImport` in `obligations/obligations.js`
(a search-and-replace typo, or an accidental refactor).

```diff
-export const reasonForImport = {
+export const reasonForImportRENAMED = {
   id: 'd34e5f6a-7b8c-4d9e-8f01-2a3b4c5d6e7f',
   name: 'reasonForImport',
   ...
 }
```

**Result:** `9 of 13` test files fail before a single assertion runs —
every file that imports `reasonForImport` throws `ReferenceError` at
module load.

Failing files: `contract.test.js`, `dump.test.js`, `integration.test.js`,
`sketches.test.js`, `domain/index.test.js`,
`obligations/evaluator.test.js`, `obligations/evaluator.units.test.js`,
`routes.test.js`, `lib/build-field-descriptors.test.js`.

Sample output:

```
ReferenceError: reasonForImport is not defined
❯ prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/obligations/obligations.js:654:3
❯ prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/contract.test.js:3:1
```

**Invariant caught:** the obligation identity graph is compiled at
module-load time. A rename you forget to propagate cannot silently
survive — the next `vitest run` shows nine red files immediately.

---

## Mutation 2 — change enum option list

**Change:** narrow `PURPOSE_BY_REASON['internal-market']` in
`domain/index.js` from four options to two.

```diff
 const PURPOSE_BY_REASON = {
-  'internal-market': ['breeding', 'slaughter', 'fattening', 'other']
+  'internal-market': ['breeding', 'ranching']
 }
```

**Result:** `4 tests` fail, across four files. Two files hit the
computed-enum output directly, two hit it through label rendering:

| Test file              | Failing test                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain/index.test.js` | `computedEnum — purposeInInternalMarket › returns internal-market sub-values when reason is internal-market`        |
| `integration.test.js`  | `option filtering › optionsFor(purposeInInternalMarket) depends on reasonForImport`                                 |
| `sketches.test.js`     | `optionListsForPage › surfaces the enum options a controller would render`                                          |
| `routes.test.js`       | `page-controller — option filtering › purpose-details shows options only after reason-for-import = internal-market` |

The routes test failure is the most telling: it catches the mutation
through the rendered HTML — `expect(res.payload).toContain('Fattening')`
fails because "Fattening" is no longer in the DOM.

**Invariant caught:** the domain layer is the single source of truth
for enum options. Change the source, and behaviour changes everywhere
(model tests, controller tests, HTTP tests) coherently. That's the
"one place to change" claim, tested.

---

## Mutation 3 — widen an obligation whitelist (~~coverage gap~~ **closed — see appendix**)

**Change:** widen `PACKAGE_COUNT_COMMODITIES` in
`obligations/obligations.js` from four commodity codes to six.

```diff
 export const PACKAGE_COUNT_COMMODITIES = [
   '01064100', // Bees
   '01063100', // Birds of Prey
   '01061900', // Cats / Dogs / Ferrets
-  '0102' // Cattle
+  '0102',    // Cattle
+  '0103',    // Pig (WIDENED)
+  '010410'   // Sheep (WIDENED)
 ]
```

**Result:** **all 345 tests still pass.**

The whitelist gates `numberOfPackages` scope only on commodity lines
whose code is in the list. No test walks a scripted fulfilment through
a `commodityCode = '0103'` line and asserts that `numberOfPackages` is
now in scope — so the change slips through unnoticed.

**Invariant NOT caught** — this is a genuine coverage gap the mutation
walkthrough exposes. Step 4 (the "how to add X" + coverage test) will
close it: a `numberOfPackages` scope-membership test that iterates
every whitelisted commodity code and asserts scope in a scripted state.
Step 6 (V4 buildout) will probably tighten it further when whitelist
membership becomes user-visible.

**Invariant we thought we had:** whitelist changes on
commodity-code-gated obligations propagate to downstream scope
decisions. That's true — but proven only by inspection, not by a test.

---

## Mutation 4 — flip a scope-gate predicate

**Change:** in `purposeInInternalMarket`'s `applyTo`, swap the
in-scope branch of the gate from `internal-market` to
`transit-through-eu`.

```diff
 export const purposeInInternalMarket = {
   ...
   applyTo: branchedGate(
-    (fulfilments) => fulfilments[reasonForImport.id] === 'internal-market',
+    (fulfilments) => fulfilments[reasonForImport.id] === 'transit-through-eu',
     ...
   )
 }
```

**Result:** `15 tests` fail, across six files. This is the widest
impact of the five mutations because scope is the load-bearing
mechanism the whole three-layer thesis rests on.

Representative failures:

- `integration.test.js › page visibility › purpose-details is NA when reasonForImport is not internal-market`
- `integration.test.js › task list rollup › origin-and-reason is F on the transit path (purpose auto-NA)`
- `integration.test.js › navigation › firstUnfulfilledPage returns null when section is F (transit path)`
- `contract.test.js › status › statusOfPage is NA when nothing presented is in scope`
- `contract.test.js › navigation › nextAfter walks within the subsection first`
- `dump.test.js › dump.report(internal-market-partial) › reflects reason set, purpose still pending`
- `routes.test.js › page-controller — option filtering › purpose-details shows options only after reason-for-import = internal-market`
- `obligations/evaluator.test.js › V4 — purposeInInternalMarket conditional gate › is mandatory in-scope when reasonForImport is internal-market`
- `lib/build-field-descriptors.test.js › buildFieldDescriptors › filters out obligations that are out of scope`

**Invariant caught:** the entire three-layer chain — scope decision,
container status rollup, navigation, field-descriptor filtering,
rendered HTML, dump-snapshot output — all pivot on the obligation's
`applyTo`. Change the gate, and every layer notices, at every test
level (evaluator unit, contract, integration, HTTP `server.inject`,
dump snapshot). This is the strongest evidence of "provable via tests"
in the whole walkthrough.

---

## Mutation 5 — add a new obligation, leave it unwired (~~coverage gap~~ **closed — see appendix**)

**Change:** add a new mandatory singleton obligation
`insurancePolicyNumber` to the manifest, but **do not** wire it into
`domain/index.js`, `flow/flow.js`, or `lib/presentation.js`.

```diff
 export const obligations = [
+  insurancePolicyNumber,
   countryOfOrigin,
   ...
```

**Result:** **all 345 tests still pass.**

But — the signal IS there:

- `data-dictionary-sketch.js coverageReport()` reports
  `withoutDomainEntry: 15` (up from 14), and `missing` includes
  `'insurancePolicyNumber'`.
- The obligation would show in the `dump.js` output as an in-scope
  mandatory entry with no fulfilment, i.e. it would surface in
  `missingRequired` — but the `dump.test.js` snapshots don't currently
  assert against every entry, so the addition passes through.

Verified in a scratch `_scratch-mutation5.test.js` — asserting on
`coverageReport().missing` catches the mutation immediately. Removing
the scratch file leaves the coverage still uncalled by the main suite.

**Invariant NOT caught** — the coverage-report signal exists but isn't
asserted. This is exactly what step 4 turns into a proper failing
test (`coverageReport()` → `expect(report.missing).toEqual([])`, or an
allow-list of "text-fallback OK" obligations).

**Invariant we DO want:** every obligation in the manifest either
has a domain entry, is on an explicit allow-list, or fails the build.

---

## Summary — what the five mutations prove

|  #  | Mutation               | Failing files | Failing tests | Invariant                                                   |
| :-: | ---------------------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Rename obligation      |       9       | catastrophic  | Identity graph checked at module load                       |
|  2  | Change enum options    |       4       |       4       | Domain is single source of truth for options                |
|  3  | Widen whitelist        |       1       |       1       | ~~Coverage gap~~ — closed by `whitelists.test.js`           |
|  4  | Flip scope-gate        |       6       |      15       | Scope changes ripple through every layer                    |
|  5  | Add unwired obligation |       1       |       1       | ~~Coverage gap~~ — closed by `obligations/coverage.test.js` |

Two coverage gaps were discovered in the original run — mutations 3
and 5 fell through. Both are now closed by new tests, added in the
same session as this walkthrough. See "Closing the gaps" below for
what the closure covers and how to prove it fires.

## How to reproduce

Every mutation above uses a one-line `sed` or `diff`. To replay any of
them:

```bash
cd repos/trade-imports-animals-frontend

# Apply mutation (example: mutation 1)
sed -i '' 's/^export const reasonForImport =/export const reasonForImportRENAMED =/' \
  prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/obligations/obligations.js

# Run the tests
npx vitest run prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/

# Revert
sed -i '' 's/^export const reasonForImportRENAMED =/export const reasonForImport =/' \
  prototypes/journey-config-spikes/EUDPA-249-flow-layer/obligations/obligations.js
```

Same pattern for the other four; the diff blocks above are pasteable.

## What this walkthrough is not

- Not full mutation testing (Stryker, etc.). Five hand-picked
  mutations against the specific invariants we claim to prove.
- Not a claim that the test suite is complete — mutations 3 and 5
  originally demonstrated real gaps. The closure appendix records how
  each was fixed.
- Not a one-off. Re-run this walkthrough after major model changes
  to confirm the invariants still hold and the coverage story hasn't
  slipped.

---

## Closing the gaps

The two coverage gaps mutations 3 and 5 originally exposed are now
closed by new tests. Both tests were added in the same session as
this walkthrough, and both were verified by re-applying the exact
mutations they cover.

### Gap 3 — whitelist widening

**Closed by:** [`obligations/whitelists.test.js`](../obligations/whitelists.test.js) (34 tests).

The test covers all seven commodity-code-scoped obligations:

- `PACKAGE_COUNT_COMMODITIES → numberOfPackages` (line-scoped)
- `CPH_REQUIRED_COMMODITIES → cph` (top-level `anyAllowListed`)
- `PASSPORT_COMMODITIES → passport` (unit-record-scoped)
- `TATTOO_COMMODITIES → tattoo` (unit-record-scoped)
- `EAR_TAG_COMMODITIES → earTag` (unit-record-scoped)
- `HORSE_NAME_COMMODITIES → horseName` (unit-record-scoped)
- `PERMANENT_ADDRESS_COMMODITIES → permanentAddress` (unit-record-scoped)

For each pair, the test scripts a state with the given commodity
code, evaluates, and asserts the gated obligation is in scope. Plus
a control code assertion (a synthetic code not in any V4 whitelist)
verifies the negative path.

**The key anti-drift move:** the test also compares each imported
whitelist against a hard-coded `EXPECTED` map. Iterating the imported
list alone would just add passing cases when the list widens — the
equality check against the `EXPECTED` map is what catches drift.

**Proof it works:** re-apply mutation 3 (widen `PACKAGE_COUNT_COMMODITIES`
to add `'0103'` and `'010410'`). The test
`PACKAGE_COUNT_COMMODITIES contains exactly the expected codes` fails;
the two new positive cases pass but the equality check fires.

To intentionally change a whitelist:

1. edit the constant in `obligations.js`
2. update the matching `EXPECTED` entry in `whitelists.test.js`
3. re-run tests — new positive cases pass, drift check passes

Any single-file edit fails the drift check. That's the invariant.

### Gap 5 — unwired obligation

**Closed by:** [`obligations/coverage.test.js`](../obligations/coverage.test.js) (3 tests).

Every obligation in the manifest must be either:

- wired to a `domain/index.js` entry (has legal-value semantics), OR
- explicitly present on the `KNOWN_UNWIRED` allow-list.

The allow-list has ~26 current entries (standard address blocks,
group containers, per-unit identifiers, accompanying-document block)
— each represents V4 work parked for step 5 (V4 buildout). As step 5
wires each, the entry gets removed from `KNOWN_UNWIRED`.

Two anti-drift guards:

- **The allow-list can't contain obligations that were later wired.**
  Wire something, remove it from the allow-list, or the check fires.
- **The allow-list can't contain orphans.** Rename an obligation, and
  the corresponding `KNOWN_UNWIRED` entry must be updated too.

**Proof it works:** re-apply mutation 5 (add
`insurancePolicyNumber` to the manifest, don't wire it). The test
`has no obligation that lacks both a domain entry and an allow-list entry`
fails, listing `insurancePolicyNumber` in the received-missing array.

### Baseline after gap-closing

**15 test files, 382 tests, all pass.** Up from 13/345 before the two
new test files landed.

The updated mutation summary table at the top of this document reflects
the closure — mutations 3 and 5 now show 1 failing test each rather
than 0.

---

## Round 2 — six more mutations, one more gap

Once round 1 had shipped and the two gaps were closed, we ran a
second batch to probe deeper invariants: the evaluator's category
classifier, domain-manifest key alignment, `within` structural
references, page-`presents` alignment, `within` deletion, and
uniqueness (duplicate obligation `name`).

Baseline: 15 test files, 382 tests before round 2 started. All five
of the closure tests from round 1 were unchanged.

### Mutation 6 — change the evaluator's category classifier

**Change:** in `obligations/evaluator.js`, misclassify group-shaped
obligations as `'single'`.

```diff
     } else if (obligationChildren.has(o.id)) {
-      obligationsByCategory.set(o.id, 'group')
+      obligationsByCategory.set(o.id, 'single')
     } else {
```

**Result:** 32 tests fail across 6 files — evaluator unit tests,
integration tests, dump snapshots, HTTP route walks. `commodityLine`
and `unitRecord` stop behaving as groups; downstream fan-out breaks
at every layer.

**Invariant caught:** the category classifier is at the very bottom of
the evaluator; downstream behaviour is heavily tested against it.

### Mutation 7 — misalign a domain-manifest key

**Change:** in `domain/index.js`, key `reasonForImportDomain` under
`countryOfOrigin.id` instead of `reasonForImport.id`.

**Result:** 6 tests fail across 5 files. **`obligations/coverage.test.js`
fires** — one of the round-1 closure tests — because `reasonForImport`
is now missing from the domain map AND not on `KNOWN_UNWIRED`. The
other five failures are downstream: contract validation, sketches,
build-field-descriptors, domain manifest self-check. A nice
cross-mutation win: the round-1 coverage test also catches Round 2's
misalignment.

**Invariant caught:** the domain manifest must map each key to the
domain entry for the correctly-keyed obligation. Coverage test is
key-aware, not just cardinality-aware.

### Mutation 8 — change a `within` reference

**Change:** in `obligations/obligations.js`, change `passport.within`
from `unitRecord` to `commodityLine`.

**Result:** 8 tests fail across 2 files — evaluator group-semantics
tests (unit-record path enumeration breaks), the `whitelists.test.js`
round-1 closure tests (records at `line1/unit1` no longer materialise
because passport is now line-scoped, not unit-scoped). Another
cross-mutation win: the round-1 whitelist coverage catches structural
`within` changes.

**Invariant caught:** the hierarchy of `within` references shapes
group inference; changing a level ripples into every unit-record
scope test.

**Note:** `numberOfPackages.within` cannot be similarly mutated to
`unitRecord` because `unitRecord` is declared later in the file — the
mutation fails at module load with a temporal-dead-zone
`ReferenceError`. That's its own form of catch, but a boring one.

### Mutation 9 — swap a page's `presents` obligation

**Change:** in `flow/flow.js`, change `reason-for-import` page's
presented obligation from `reasonForImport` to `countryOfOrigin`.

```diff
               page: 'reason-for-import',
-              presents: [{ obligation: reasonForImport }]
+              presents: [{ obligation: countryOfOrigin }]
```

**Result:** 11 tests fail across 5 files — contract navigation
(`changeLinkFor` resolves to wrong page), contract validation, HTTP
route walks (`POST /pages/country-of-origin` no longer redirects to
`/pages/reason-for-import`), sketches, build-field-descriptors.

**Invariant caught:** the wiring between page and obligation is tested
at both the contract level and the HTTP level. A mis-wire fails at both.

### Mutation 10 — delete `commodityCode`'s `within`

**Change:** in `obligations/obligations.js`, remove `within: commodityLine`
from `commodityCode`.

**Result:** **164 tests fail across 7 files** — the widest impact of
any mutation in this document. `commodityCode` is central to the V4
model; removing its `within` breaks group inference, storage purge,
per-line applyTo evaluation, and every downstream layer.

**Invariant caught:** the load-bearing structural fields — anything
`commodityCode`, `commodityLine`, `unitRecord` — cannot be quietly
changed. If the test suite doesn't scream, we've missed something.

### Mutation 11 — duplicate obligation name (coverage gap — **now closed**)

**Change:** add a second obligation with `name: 'contactAddress'` (same
as the real one) but a different id.

**Result:** on first run, **all 382 tests still passed**. The
evaluator only uses `id`, not `name`, so name collisions don't affect
scope/purge/records. Downstream consumers — the data dictionary,
`presentation.js`'s name-based lookup, `KNOWN_UNWIRED` in the round-1
coverage test — silently take the first match and hide the collision.

**Fix:** extended `obligations/coverage.test.js` with two new
uniqueness assertions:

- `has no duplicate ids in the manifest` — catches a copy-paste that
  reused the same id (would collapse `obligationsById` map entries).
- `has no duplicate names in the manifest` — catches this mutation
  directly.

Both verified: re-applying mutation 11 fires the duplicate-name
assertion; a mirror mutation reusing an existing id fires the
duplicate-id assertion.

**Invariant caught after fix:** `id` and `name` are both distinct
per-obligation across the manifest.

### Round 2 summary

|  #  | Mutation                         | Failing tests | Notes                                                        |
| :-: | -------------------------------- | :-----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  6  | Category classifier misclassify  |      32       | Evaluator + downstream fanout                                |

| 11  | Duplicate obligation name        |   0 → **1**   | ~~gap~~ closed by new uniqueness tests in `coverage.test.js` |

Baseline after round 2 closure: **15 test files, 384 tests, all pass.**
Up by 2 tests (the two uniqueness assertions).

### What round 2 taught us

Two cross-mutation wins (7 and 8) — the round-1 closure tests
independently caught round-2 mutations they weren't designed for. That
suggests the closure tests are load-bearing beyond their own
mutations, which is a stronger signal than a fresh coverage test would
be alone.

One new gap (11) — duplicate names. Fixed in-session. The `id`
uniqueness test doesn't currently fire against any real drift because
the imports would have already crashed if two `export const foo`
statements shared a name, and the ids are hand-assigned; but it's
cheap insurance for a future data-driven manifest.

No structural test failed to catch a real mutation the way mutations 3
and 5 originally did in round 1. All six round-2 mutations either fired
directly, exposed a duplicate-name gap, or crashed at module load.

---

## Round 3 — five more mutations, one more closed gap, one deferred

Round 3 probed at the corners: `flow.js` page-name uniqueness, obligation
manifest ordering, self-referential `within`, evaluator-helper semantics
(`allowListed` inversion), and presentation-copy changes.

Baseline before round 3: **15 test files, 384 tests, all pass.**

### Mutation 12 — duplicate page name in `flow.js`

**Change:** in `flow/flow.js`, rename `purpose-details` to
`reason-for-import` — two pages now share a name in the same tree.

**Result:** 13 tests fail across 6 files. Interestingly, `routes.test.js`
also **skips 14 tests** because Hapi rejects the duplicate route
registration at `server.initialize()` with
`AssertError: New route /prototype/eudpa-249/pages/reason-for-import conflicts with existing`,
which crashes the entire test file's `beforeAll` hook.

**Invariant caught:** page-name uniqueness — enforced structurally by
Hapi at route registration, and by the contract-navigation tests
(`changeLinkFor`, `nextAfter`) which resolve to the first match and
fail sanity checks.

### Mutation 13 — reorder the obligations manifest

**Change:** in `obligations/obligations.js`, reorder the top of the
`obligations = [ ... ]` array — `countryOfOrigin` moves to slot 4,
`reasonForImport` to slot 1, etc.

**Result:** **all 384 tests pass.** Confirmed the doc-level claim that
manifest order is not load-bearing — the evaluator builds
`obligationsById` and `obligationChildren` maps from `within`
references, not from array position.

**Invariant confirmed:** manifest reorder is a safe no-op. Useful data
point when refactoring the manifest during V4 buildout.

### Mutation 14 — circular `within` self-loop (~~coverage gap~~ **closed**)

**Change:** in `obligations/obligations.js`, after `commodityLine` is
declared, mutate `commodityLine.within = commodityLine`.

**Result:** **the test suite hangs.** `buildAncestorGroups` walks
`while (cur) cur = cur.within` and never terminates. `pkill -f vitest`
required to abort.

This is worse than mutation 3 or 5 originally were in round 1 —
uncaught AND catastrophic-at-CI. Closed by a new assertion in
`obligations/coverage.test.js`:

```js
describe('structural integrity — no cycles in `within` references', () => {
  it('every obligation has a within-chain that terminates in null', () => {
    // Walk each obligation's `within` chain with a seen-set and a
    // max-depth bound. Any cycle fails deterministically in ~ms
    // before the evaluator is ever built.
    ...
  })
})
```

**Proof it works:** re-apply the mutation. The new test fires in 3 ms
and reports `commodityLine → cycle at commodityLine`; no hang.

**Invariant caught after fix:** `within` chains terminate in null.

### Mutation 15 — invert `allowListed`'s matcher

**Change:** in `obligations/helpers.js`, change
`(value) => values.includes(value)` to
`(value) => !values.includes(value)`. Every commodity-code gate now
inverts.

**Result:** 48 tests fail across 3 files. The evaluator's own V4 suite
carries the burden — `numberOfPackages` `is out of scope when no line
has a package-count commodity code` now shows scope; `cph is mandatory
in scope on a cattle line` now shows out-of-scope; etc.

**Invariant caught:** the helper's semantics are heavily tested at
the evaluator's V4-scenario layer. Changing the primitive breaks the
scenarios.

### Mutation 16 — subtle presentation-copy change (**gap — deferred**)

**Change:** in `lib/presentation.js`, change `countryOfOrigin.pageTitle`
from `'Country of origin'` to `'Country of origin (subtly changed)'`.
The substring `'Country of origin'` is preserved — matches the case-
sensitive `expect(res.payload).toContain('Country of origin')`
assertion in `routes.test.js`.

**Result:** **all 385 tests pass** (baseline is 385 after the round-3
closure).

Note: an obvious change like `'MUTATED — country of origin'` (lowercase
`c`) IS caught because the substring assertion is case-sensitive. But
anything that preserves the tested substring slips through.

**Gap — not closed.** Presentation copy is UX territory:

- A snapshot test on rendered HTML would catch it, but would fire on
  unrelated CSS/HTML changes.
- A per-entry equality check in `presentation.js` would duplicate the
  copy in two places.
- Neither is worth the maintenance burden for a spike whose PR review
  process already catches copy changes.

Recorded here so future maintainers know the gap exists and can
decide when to invest.

### Round 3 summary

Baseline after round 3: **15 test files, 385 tests, all pass** (up 1
from the cycle-detection test).

### What round 3 taught us

- The evaluator hangs (worse than fails) on a circular `within`. Now
  caught in 3 ms by a lightweight assertion.
- Manifest ordering is safe to change during refactors — good.
- Presentation-copy drift slips through the current test suite for
  anything subtler than a case-change. Deferred as UX-review
  territory.

Across three rounds and 16 mutations, four gaps found (mutations
3, 5, 11, 14 originally), three closed in-session (3, 5, 11, 14), one
deferred (16 — presentation copy).
