# Design delta vs obligations-v2-spike@1d0a904

Engine/flow/lib/shared divergences from the vendored source, per
PROVENANCE.md. Candidates to flow back to the spike as findings.

## 1. `activatedBy.includes` accepts a list (inc-003, 5ff76d6)

`engine/evaluate/predicate.js`: `includes` generalised from a single
target to set-intersection — a list target means "the answer (scalar or
array) includes any of these values". Needed by
`numberOfPackages.activatedBy = { commoditySelection, includes: [54 commodity codes] }`;
the M2 `frame: "anyItem"` / `frame: "enclosing"` work will use the same
form. Backwards compatible (single-target behaviour unchanged; all
pre-existing tests untouched). Documented in `docs/obligation-model.md`;
`analysis/reachability.js#gateValue` updated to pick a representative
activating value from a list.

## 2. Session cookie renamed (inc-001, f27b76c)

`engine/persistence/session.js`: `obligationsV2JourneyId` →
`liveAnimalsJourneyId`. Not a semantic divergence — both prototypes
register on one Hapi server and `server.state()` rejects duplicate
cookie names; the spike itself is unaffected. Arguably part of the
vendoring rename rather than a delta; recorded for completeness.
